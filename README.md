# Bikesharing

## Overview of the analysis
A trip analysis will be added to a bike-sharing business proposal at the request of a potential angel investor interested in providing seed funding to explore a bike share project in Des Moines.  
<br />
The three technical deliverables required to complete the bikesharing analysis include <br />

1. Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format.
2. Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis.
3. Create a Story and Report for the Final Presentation.

## Resources
- Data Source: This analysis was performed using the  [201908-citibike-tripdata.cvs](https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html) dataset.
-  Code: [NYC_Citibike_Challenge.ipynb](https://github.com/aobasuyi/Bikesharing/blob/main/NYC_Citibike_Challenge.ipynb) a
- Data Tools: Jupyter Notebook, CSV, Tableau and IO (Web Server)
- Software: Jupyter Notebook and Visual Studio Code 1.50.0

## Results:
### Deliverable 1
#### Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format <br />
- Using Python and Pandas functions, convert the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype to get the time in hours, minutes, and seconds (00:00:00). 
- Convert the "tripduration" column to a datetime dataytpe, then export the DataFrame as a CSV file to use for the trip analysis
##### Code:
```
# Files to load
CitiBike_data_to_load = "201908-citibike-tripdata.csv"

# 1. Create a DataFrame for the 201908-citibike-tripdata data. 
CitiBike_df = pd.read_csv(CitiBike_data_to_load)
CitiBike_df.head()

# 2. Check the datatypes of your columns. 
CitiBike_df.dtypes

# 3. Convert the 'tripduration' column to datetime datatype.
CitiBike_df['tripduration_orig'] =CitiBike_df['tripduration']
CitiBike_df["tripduration"] = pd.to_datetime(CitiBike_df["tripduration"], unit='s')  

# 4. Check the datatypes of your columns. 
CitiBike_df.info()

# 5a. Create the output File (CSV)
output_data_file = "NewYork_CitiBike.csv"

# 5b. Export the Dataframe as a new CSV file without the index.
CitiBike_df.to_csv(output_data_file, index=False)

```

### Deliverable 2
#### Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis: <br />

a). How long bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.

<br /> ![Image](Resources/Visualization/Checkout_times_users.png) <br />

- Most Citi bike trips lasted less than one hour with the highest bike ride lasting about 6 minutes. Males were 3 times more likely that than females to use bike rideshare .<br />  <br />

b).  How many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week, for all riders and genders.

<br /> ![Image](Resources/Visualization/Trips_weekday_gender.png) <br />

- Users are most likely to bike rideshare between 5 and 6 pm on weekdays except for Wednesdays. Saturdays peak hours start at 10 and lasts thorugh 7pm.
- Males are more likely that than females to use bike rideshare on weekdays.
<br />
c.) A breakdown of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by type of user and gender.

- Male subscribers are more likey to use the ride bikeshare on weekdays.
- Unknown customers use ride bikeshare the most on Saturdays.
<br />

### Deliverable 3
 <br />

#### Create a Story and Report for the Final Presentation <br />

- Create a story in Tableau and write a report that describes the key outcomes of the NYC Citibike analysis.

- Overview
<br /> ![Image](Resources/Dashboard_story/DesMoines_overview.png) <br />

- The CitiBike ridesharing average trip duration has been insceraing steadily since 1990. A typical citi bikeshare user is a male subscriber.

- Checkout Times

<br /> ![Image](Resources/Dashboard_story/DesMoines_trip-duration_riders.png) <br />

- Male users are more likely to use the bike rideshare for a trip lasting less than 40 minutes

- Weekday by hour

<br /> ![Image](Resources/Dashboard_story/DesMoines_trips_weekday_hour.png) <br />

- Citi bike rideshare peak hours are 8 am, 5pm and 6 pm on weekdays except for Saturdays. Males are most likely to use the bike rideshare

 - Usertype and gender
<br /> ![Image](Resources/Dashboard_story/DesMoines_trips_usertype.png) <br />

- Male subcribers are most likely to use bike rideshare on weekdays.

- Top 10 stations

- Pershing Square North is the top starting station at

| Top 10 starting stations  | Top 10 ending stations |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| ![Top 10 starting](Resources/Dashboard_story/DesMoines_top_starting_stations.png)  | ![Top 10 ending](Resources/Dashboard_story/DesMoines_top_ending_stations.png) |


- Pershing Square North is teh top starting and ending station 

- Average Bike Utilization

<br /> ![Image](Resources/Dashboard_story/DesMoines_bike_utilization.png) <br />

- Bike utilization by customsers are hignest for bike IDs 

## Summary:
- The average trip duration for bike ridesharing has steadily increased since 1990s.
Male subscribers are most likely to use citi Bike rideshare on for each hour and weekdays.
- Two additional visualizations suggested for future analysis include
 - Predict the average trip utilization for the next five years
 - Determine top starting and stopping station by a.) usertype amd b.) gender to find ways to increase bike sharing use by both groups.
